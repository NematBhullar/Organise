## 1. About 
A task management app that displays a list of tasks to be completed to make it easier to stay organised. Users are able to enter and add a task to the list. Each task can be edited or deleted once completed.

In the project directory, run:

### `npm install`

This installs a package and any dependencies.

### `npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.
